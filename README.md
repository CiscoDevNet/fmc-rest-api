## Cisco DevNet Learning Labs: Firepower Management Center

These self-paced interactive tutorials provide instructions to visualize threat data provided by the Firepower Management Center (FMC). 

Labs are written to be displayed within the [Cisco DevNet Learning Labs system](https://developer.cisco.com/learning).

Contributions are welcome, and we are glad to review changes through pull requests. See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for details.

Once approved, Cisco DevNet reviewers then create a release that is published through our Learning Labs system. 

The goal of these Learning Labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than just theory or instructions.

## About these Learning Labs

Explores basic analysis of threats and compromised hosts.

## Preview Learning Lab Markdown locally

Refer to the instruction for your text editor for Markdown previewing. For example, [Markdown and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown) describes how to configure Markdown extensions. 

## Contributing

These learning modules are for public consumption, so you must ensure that you have the rights to any content that you contribute.

Write your content in Markdown. DevNet staff reviews content according to the [Cisco Style Guide](http://www-author.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/style/guide/Latest/stylegd.html). (Link available on Cisco VPN only.)

#### Publishing Requirements

To create and publish a new lab, take the following steps:
- Add a new folder under `labs`.
- Create a JSON file with the same name as the `labs/`_folder_ name.
- Create markdown files named 1.md, 2.md, and so on; refer to those files in the `labs/`_folder_ JSON file.
- Ensure that the JSON file contains appropriate page titles and file references.
- Send a pull request to get the files committed and merged to the default branch by a DevNet reviewer.

A DevNet reviewer then creates a release on the repository with the latest changes and publishes through the admin interface.

#### Editors

You can write Markdown in a plain text editor, but there are many desktop and Web-based options that allow you to write and preview your work at the same time. We recommend Visual Studio Code [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for several reasons:
- Lightweight environment for coding (or writing Markdown)
- Available on Mac OS, Linux or Windows
- Github Client integration
- Great Markdown preview features native in the editor
- Intuitive operation and structure

You can validate a JSON file by using the [online formatter and validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com).
