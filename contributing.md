# How to contribute to a Learning Lab

For Learning Labs, you can help in these primary ways:

- Testing the Learning Lab, and then reporting issues in the repo or in the common issues tracking repo.
- Using the Issue tracker to report issues, or comment that you will work on an issue.
- Updating the content in the Learning Lab repo.
- Requesting or creating a release.
- Contacting DevNet to publish new or updated Learning Labs.


## Using the issue tracker

For Learning Labs, there are two potential places to track issues, depending on whether the repo is public or private.

For public repo Learning Labs, use the issue tracker in the repo. All Learning Labs repos in the CiscoDevNet organization have a topic of learning-labs.

For private Learning Labs, use the common issue tracker in the [CiscoDevNet/learning-labs-issues](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/learning-labs-issues) repo.

For DevNet Express events, use these Issue tracker repos based on the content track:

* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-dna-issues
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-cc-issues
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-dci-issues
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-security-issues/issues/

Use the issue tracker to suggest additions, report bugs, and ask questions. This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project and find others interested in this solution.

Also use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Test a lab, find a bug, log an issue. Or offer an update, comment on the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the ``Changing the Learning Lab`` content guidance below.


## Changing the Learning Lab content

Generally speaking, you should clone the Learning Lab repository, make changes locally, and then submit a Pull Request (PR). We expect you have validated that all documented tasks work as expected. Plus, the content should follow the [Learning Lab Style Guide](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/wiki/Lab-Style-Guide).

The [DevNet Writing Guidelines Wiki](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/wiki) describes the review and publishing process in detail. Please feel free to request reviews from DevNet contributors you see in the repository and we will review submissions.
