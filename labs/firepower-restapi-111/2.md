where e276abec-e0f2-11e3-8169-6d9ed49b625f is the DOMAIN_UUID obtained from the generate token step.
3. In the header add:
> Key:  X-auth-access-token  Value: Paste the value obtained from the generate token step

### To View Indicators of Compromise

1. To see all Indicators of Compromise downloaded by TID, a GET ALL operation can be performed as shown below.
![Figure: FMC REST API explorer screen shot ](/posts/files/firepower-restapi-111/assets/images/Picture7.png)
2.  To retrieve a specific indicator, an objectId needs to be provided for the Get operation.
For ex: https://64.103.37.24/api/fmc_tid/v1/domain/e276abec-e0f2-11e3-8169-6d9ed49b625f/tid/indicator/objectId
3. More complex queries can be run on the data to get enhanced results.
The screenshot below shows a query to get all indicators ingested in the last one hour by specifying a filter, sorted by updatedAt time field and the first 40 results matching the criteria are to be returned with all links expanded.

### Sample Get Request:
https://64.103.37.24/api/fmc_tid/v1/domain/e276abec-e0f2-11e3-8169-6d9ed49b625f/tid/indicator?filter=updatedAt:1494831366..1495436166&sort=-updatedAt&limit=40&expanded=true

Following are the key/value pairs:

|Key | Value|
|filter | updatedAt:1495425937..1495429537|
|sort | -updatedAt|
|expanded | true|
|limit | 40|

### To view Observables

The Indicators of Compromise can be broken down into constituent observables like IPs, Domains, URLs etc. Follow the steps described in the Indicators of Compromise section.
Sample Get Request:
https://64.103.37.24/api/fmc_tid/v1/domain/e276abec-e0f2-11e3-8169-6d9ed49b625f/tid/observable?filter=updatedAt:1494831366..1495436166&sort=-updatedAt&limit=40&expanded=true

### To view Incidents

Incidents are generated when the observables contained with the indicators are detected by the sensors. Follow the steps described in the Indicators of Compromise section.
