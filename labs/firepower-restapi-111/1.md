# FMC - REST - API - 111

## Lab Objective

Basic understanding of Cisco Threat Intelligence Director (TID) APIs and their usage via API Explorer and Postman.  

Completion time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites
Basic understanding of REST principles
Optional: Learning Lab "FMC - REST - API - 102" to get basic understanding of accessing FMC REST APIs using tokens.

## Learning Objective
After completing this module you will have a
basic understanding of the available FMC TID APIs and their usage.

## FMC REST API Explorer
The API Explorer provides the list of APIs available on the Firepower Management Center (FMC), their details and the ability to make permissible Rest API Calls using a simplified API console.

### Using API Explorer:
1. Navigate to the URL: https://management_center_IP_or_name/api/api-explorer Or try the DevNet live sandbox https://64.103.37.24/api/api-explorer/

2. Log in with your username and password and click "Sign In"

3. Select the Intelligence tab on from the left most menu to see all the available APIs available for the Cisco Threat Intelligence Director.

## Creating a TID Source

### To Create a TID Source using URL download
1. Select API Operations on Source objects and choose the POST Operation.
Based on the type of source and its contents you can modify the fields feedType, feedContent in the JSON sample below.

2. In the API CONSOLE post the JSON below to configure a stix source named "PoisonIvy" and located at:
https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/3wytyptmlbuvn7wy47w66bhvdjkkptw8.xml

3. A successful post operation return a 201 OK.

```JSON
{
	"name": "PoisonIvy",
		"uri":"https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/3wytyptmlbuvn7wy47w66bhvdjkkptw8.xml",
	"feedType": "stix",
	"feedContent": "stix",
	"delivery": "url",
	"refresh": 1440,
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"downloadOn": true,
	"params": {
		"selfSignedServerCertificate": "false",
		"hostnameVerifier": "allow_all"
	},
	"property": {
		"ttl": 90,
		"publish": true,
		"action": "monitor"
	}
}
```
4. Optional: To download a simple IP intelligence source located at:
https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/phef4u63td7bxcgkgyt1vk5vrm461jcf.txt

In the API CONSOLE post the JSON below.

```JSON
{
	"name": "TorIpList",
	              "uri":"https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/phef4u63td7bxcgkgyt1vk5vrm461jcf.txt",
	"feedType": "flatfile",
	"feedContent": "IPV_4_ADDR",
	"delivery": "url",
	"refresh": 1440,
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"downloadOn": true,
	"params": {
		"selfSignedServerCertificate": "false",
		"hostnameVerifier": "allow_all"
	},
	"property": {
		"ttl": 90,
		"publish": true,
		"action": "monitor"
	}
            }
```

### To view Indicators of Compromise
1. Select API Operations on Indicator objects.
2. To see all Indicators of Compromise downloaded by TID, a GET ALL operation can be performed by simply pressing GET.
3. To retrieve a specific indicator object an objectId needs to be provided for the Get operation.

4. More complex queries can be run on the data to get enhanced results.
The screenshot below shows a query to get all indicators ingested in the last one hour by specifying a filter, sorted by updatedAt time field and returned with all links expanded.
|Key | Value |
|filter |	updatedAt:1495425937..1495429537 |
|sort 	|	-updatedAt |
|expanded | true |

### To View Observables

The Indicators of Compromise can be broken down into constituent observables like IPs, Domains, URLs etc.

* Select API Operations on observable objects and follow the steps described in the Indicators of Compromise section.


### To View Incidents

Incidents are generated when the observables contained with the indicators are detected by the sensors.
* Select API Operations on Indicator objects and follow the steps described in the Indicators of Compromise section.
