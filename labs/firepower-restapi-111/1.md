# FMC REST API 111

## Objectives

This lab teaches you the basic understanding of Cisco Threat Intelligence Director (TID) APIs and their usage via API Explorer and Postman.  

After completing this module you will have a basic understanding of the available Firepower Management Center (FMC) TID APIs and their usage.

## Prerequisites
It's best if you already  have basic understanding of REST principles. Optionally, you can work through [Learning Lab "FMC - REST - API - 102](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/firepower-restapi-102/step/1) before this lab, in order to get basic understanding of accessing FMC REST APIs using tokens.

## FMC REST API Explorer
The API Explorer provides the list of APIs available on the FMC, their details, and the ability to make permissible Rest API calls using a simplified API console.


### Using API Explorer:
1. Navigate to the https://management_center_IP_or_name/api/api-explorer URL. Or try the [DevNet Live Sandbox](https://cisco-tid.cisco.com/api/api-explorer/).

2. Log in with your username and password and click "Sign In".

3. Select the Intelligence tab on from the left-most menu to see all the APIs available for the Cisco TID.

## Creating a TID Source

### To Create a TID Source using URL download
1. Select API Operations on Source objects and choose the POST Operation. Based on the type of source and its contents, you can modify the fields `feedType` and `feedContent` in the JSON sample below.

2. In the API CONSOLE, post the JSON below to configure a [STIX source](https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/hxlc1d1r8u3naaj876mqwucuqjuywx01.txt).  

Change the name of the source to a unique name instead of "WannaCry".

3. A successful post operation returns a 201 OK.
```JSON
{
	"name": "WannaCry",
	"uri":"https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/hxlc1d1r8u3naaj876mqwucuqjuywx01.txt",
	"feedType": "stix",
	"feedContent": "stix",
	"delivery": "url",
	"refresh": 1440,
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"downloadOn": true,
	"params": {
		"selfSignedServerCertificate": "false",
		"hostnameVerifier": "allow_all"
	},
	"property": {
		"ttl": 90,
		"publish": true,
		"action": "monitor"
	}
}
```

4. *Optional:* To download a simple IP intelligence source located at:
https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/phef4u63td7bxcgkgyt1vk5vrm461jcf.txt

Change the name of the source to a unique name instead of `TorIpList`.

In the API CONSOLE post the JSON below.

```JSON
{
	"name": "TorIpList",
	"uri":"https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/phef4u63td7bxcgkgyt1vk5vrm461jcf.txt",
	"feedType": "flatfile",
	"feedContent": "IPV_4_ADDR",
	"delivery": "url",
	"refresh": 1440,
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"downloadOn": true,
	"params": {
		"selfSignedServerCertificate": "false",
		"hostnameVerifier": "allow_all"
	},
	"property": {
		"ttl": 90,
		"publish": true,
		"action": "monitor"
	}
}
```


### To view indicators of compromise
1. Select API Operations on Indicator objects.
2. To see all Indicators of Compromise downloaded by TID, a GET ALL operation can be performed by simply pressing GET.
3. To retrieve a specific indicator object an objectId needs to be provided for the Get operation.

4. More complex queries can be run on the data to get enhanced results. The screenshot below shows a query to get all indicators ingested in the last one hour by specifying a filter, sorted by `updatedAt time field` and returned with all links expanded.
Following are the key/value pairs:

| KEY      | VALUE                            |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| filter   | updatedAt:1495425937..1495429537 |
| sort     | -updatedAt                        |
| expanded | true                             |
| limit    | 40                               |

### To View observables

Observables represent stateful properties or measurable events pertinent to the operation of computers and networks. For example, IPs, Domains, URLs, File SHAâ€™s etc.

Select API Operations on observable objects and follow the steps described in the Indicators of Compromise section.


### To View incidents

Incidents are discrete instances of indicators affecting an organization, along with information discovered or decided during an incident response investigation.

Select API Operations on Indicator objects and follow the steps described in the Indicators of Compromise section.
