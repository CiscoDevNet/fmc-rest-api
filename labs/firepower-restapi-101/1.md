## What is Firepower Management Center FMC?
Firepower Management Center (FMC) provides complete and unified management over firewalls, application control, intrusion prevention, URL filtering and advance malware protection. It can help administrators to easily go from managing firewalls to controlling applications to investigating and remediating malware attacks.

Before FMCâ€™s 6.1 release, FMC could only be access via a web based GUI. In 6.1 version of FMC the first set of REST APIs to access some of the most desired features of the FMC are released. Main motivation behind these APIs was if you have existing applications, REST APIs provide an easy way to integrate the FMC with those applications. Secondly, if you have certain specific workflows for your specific use cases that you currently perform using the UI, REST APIs can enable you to automate this workflow.

To use REST API in FMC, make sure REST API is turned on in your FMC. Go to FMC UI https://hostnameorIPaddressofyourFMC click System \> Configuration \> REST API Preferences and make sure that the REST API is enabled on the FMC by default it's turned on.
