## What is Firepower Management Center?

Firepower Management Center (FMC) provides administrators with complete, unified control over firewall management, application control, intrusion prevention, URL filtering, and malware protection and remediation.

FMC 6.1 supplements the FMC web-based GUI with the first release of FMC REST APIs. These APIs enable administrators to integrate FMC with existing applications, and they also enable workflow automation.

## Enabling the FMC REST API

The FMC REST API must be enabled in your FMC setup, and it is enabled by default. It is also enabled by default in [the DevNet sandbox](https://fmcrestapisandbox.cisco.com/api/api-explorer/).

If you need to manually enable FMC REST API, follow this procedure.

1. In your browser, navigate to FMC UI. The URL will be `https://*FMC_hostname_or_address*`.

2. From the **System** menu in the upper left corner, select the **Configuration** tab.

3. On the **Configuration** tab, select **REST API Preferences** and ensure that **Enable REST API** is selected.

### Obtaining a username and password for FMC Sandbox

To log in to the FMC Sandbox, users must reserve lab time to obtain credentials.

1. Navigate to [the DevNet Sandbox documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/docs/index.gsp#security/overview) and log in with your cisco.com credentials.
2. Click **Firepower Management Center**.
3. On the DevNet Sandbox page, click the **RESERVE** button.
4. In the Reserve dialog, accept the defaults and click **Reserve**. The Sandbox reservation setup process begins, and will take several minutes to complete.

When the setup process is complete, a username and password will be emailed to you and will be displayed in the output window on this page. These credentials are valid for the duration of your reservation.

You will not be able to use these temporary credentials when the reservation has ended, but if you require further access, repeat the reservation process.

**Note**: The Sandbox is an "always-on" lab and resources are shared. Users are allocated read-only rights.
