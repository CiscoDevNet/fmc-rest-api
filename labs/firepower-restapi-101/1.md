## What is Firepower Management Center FMC?
Firepower Management Center (FMC) provides complete and unified management over firewalls, application control, intrusion prevention, URL filtering and advance malware protection. It can help administrators to easily go from managing firewalls to controlling applications to investigating and remediating malware attacks.

Before release of FMCâ€™s 6.1, FMC could only be accessed via a web based GUI. In FMC 6.1 the first set of REST APIs to access some of the most desired features of the FMC are released. The main motivation behind these APIs was for existing applications, REST APIs provide an easy way to integrate the FMC with those applications. Secondly, if you have certain specific workflows for your specific use cases currently perform using the UI, REST APIs can enable workflow automation.

## Enable FMC REST API using FMC UI
To use REST API in FMC, make sure REST API is turned on in your own FMC setup; **By default REST API is turned on FMC**.
if you are using DevNet sandbox  https://fmcrestapisandbox.cisco.com/api/api-explorer/ REST API is already enabled by the administrator.

**Note on obtaining username/password for FMC sandbox:**
```shell
The API Explorer URL is publically available. However, in order to login to the FMC, users must first be allocated credentials. This is done by reserving the lab for however long you require access i.e. hit the "RESERVE" button in the upper right of the Firepower Management Center sandbox page which can be access on this URL: https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/docs/index.gsp#security/overview

Select Firepower Management Center from the above page.

You will require cisco.com credentials to access the reservation page from the above URL

Once reserved, a username/password will be sent to you via email and also displayed in the output window on this page. These credentials are valid for the duration of your reservation. You will not be able to login to the API Explorer once the reservation as ended.

If further access is required, just reserve the lab again and new credentials will be sent out.

As this is an always on lab and resources are shared, users are allocated read only rights.
```

In case your of own FMC setup; go to FMC UI https://hostnameorIPaddressofyourFMC
