#FMC REST API Explorer
The API Explorer provides a limited interface for the REST API as well as giving a view of the abilities of the REST API.

The API Explorer resides on the Firepower Management Center, and can be accessed via the Firepower Management Center at:

You can play live with API explorer on the FMC REST API sandbox

https://fmcrestapisandbox.cisco.com/api/api-explorer/

This explorer provides the list of APIs available on the Firepower Management Center, and their details.

The first time you connect to the API Explorer you may receive an error that the connection is not secure due to an invalid certificate. You will need to add an exception in your browser to use the certificate and accept the connection.

##Authentication to the API Explorer
The REST API relies on the same authentication as the Firepower Management Center. Each function in the REST API maps to permissions in the Firepower Management Center.

You can log into the API Explorer using any account on the Firepower Management Center, but you will only be able to perform the functions for which the account has permissions. For more information on setting permissions for user roles, see the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide.

FMC REST API uses token based authentication. To invoke a REST call on FMC, you need to use valid access token. You need to add a header with key as “X-auth-access-token” and “value” containing a valid access token on every REST call to access resource URLs https://hostname:httpsport/api/fmc...

##Logging into API Explorer
The REST API uses the same authentication and permission model as the Firepower Management Center. See the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide for more information.
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/610/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v61/logging_into_firepower_system.html

Make sure you have an account on your Firepower Management Center with the required permissions to perform the tasks you want to perform using the REST API.

####Logging Procedure
*  Navigate to the following URL: https://<management_center_IP_or_name>:<https_port>/api/api-explorer
*  Log in with your username and password and click "Sign In"

####Setting the Domain
The REST API can perform functions globally, in the default domain, or in specific domains.
You must have a configured Firepower Management Center, an account with permissions to access the REST API in one or more domains configured on your FMC.
In the upper right, drop down the Domains menu and select the desired domain.

##Obtaining Sample Code
You can use the Export Operation button in API Explorer to save the displayed method example as a Python or Perl script file to your local host. This script can be used to make that REST call, and can be integrated into your application. This is meant primarily as an educational and bootstrapping tool.

Python: The Python scripts require you to install Python, available from https://www.python.org/. Once you’ve installed Python, you can run your script with python script.py username password.
Perl: Using the Perl scripts requires some additional set-up—you need five components:
* Perl package, found at http://www.perl.org/
* Bundle::CPAN, found at http://search.cpan.org/~andk/Bundle-CPAN-1.861/CPAN.pm
* REST::Client, found at http://search.cpan.org/~mcrawfor/REST-Client-88/lib/REST/Client.pm
* MIME::Base64, found at http://perldoc.perl.org/MIME/Base64.html
* JSON, found at http://search.cpan.org/~makamaka/JSON-2.90/lib/JSON.pm

The API Explorer can create sample code in Python and Perl to aid in creating a REST API client.

Here are steps to create sample code
* Select the resource where you want to obtain sample code from the API INFO menu.
* Locate the desired function and select DELETE, PUT, POST, or GET.
* Select and input all other parameters for the desired function. This will vary depending on the function.
* On the right, drop down the menu for "Export operation in" and select "Python script" or "Perl script".
* The sample code will pop up in a new window. Cut and paste this code to use in your REST API client.

##Viewing API Parameters
Each resource has a set of parameters and fields associated with it. You can view the parameters and fields by performing any of the supported operations for that resource within API Explorer.

Here are steps to obtain API parameters
* Select the desired resource.
* Select one of the supported operations for that resource.
