#Token Based Authentication

    1.  The FMC API uses the same credentials as the FMC UI. The URL expects the
        username and password in Base64 encoded format. This is attached as the
        value for "Authorization" header in the incoming request

    2.  Request: The URL for generating token is HTTP POST   on [ https://fmchostnameoripaddress/api/fmc\_platform/v1/auth/generatetoken]

    3.  The header is "Authorization": "Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0". (Base 64 encoding
        of username and password)

    4.  The status code of Response is 204. The response will contain the tokens
        attached as headers. We have two custom token headers:
        “X-auth-access-token” and “X-auth-refresh-token”.

    5.  Attach the “X-auth-access-token” header to every REST API request.
