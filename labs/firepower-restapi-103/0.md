This learning lab teaches you how to enable a network device or sensor to use the FMC.

## Objectives

When you have completed this lab, you will be able to:

* Add FMC to a device or sensor.
* Register a device to the FMC with the FMC UI.
* Register a device to the FMC through the FMC REST API.

## Prerequisites

* A development environment with typical tools and applications, as well as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
* Basic understanding of REST principles. Complete the [REST API Fundamentals Learning Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/tracks/devnet-beginner/rest-api-fundamentals/what-are-rest-apis/step/1)
