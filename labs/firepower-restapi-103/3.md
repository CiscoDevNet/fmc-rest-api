# Registering a device through FMC UI

Before you begin:
* Add FMC on the device or sensor
* Record the registration ID that you used when adding FMC

## Create access policy

To register a device to an FMC you need to create an access policy. You can do this either through REST API or through FMC UI.

Follow this procedure to create an access policy through FMC UI.

1. Log in to the FMC UI at your FMC's URL. If you are using the FMC Sandbox, the URL is https://fmcrestapisandbox.cisco.com/.
2. At the top of the screen, select the **Policies** drop-down and navigate to **Access Control** and click **Access Control**.
3. On the Access Control screen, click **New Policy**.
4. In the New Policy dialog, enter a name for the policy. You may also enter a description. Accept the default of **None** for the base policy, and select the default action that the device is going to perform.
5. Save the policy.

## Register device

After the policy has been created, you can register the device.

1. At the top of the screen, select the **Devices** drop-down and navigate to **Device Management**.
2. Click **Add** and select **Device**.
3. In the“Add Device” dialog, provide the hostname or the IP address of the device, the registration key that you created when you added FMC to the device, and select the access policy that you just created. If you provided a NAT ID, enter that as well.
4. Click **Register**.
