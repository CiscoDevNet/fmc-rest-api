# Registering a device with FMC REST API

Before you begin:

* Add FMC on the device or sensor
* Record the registration ID that you used when adding FMC

The following video walks you through the process of registering a device through the FMC REST API:  [NGFW or Firepower Device/Sensor registration with Cisco FMC using REST APIs](https://youtu.be/7eTFSfL0EkU).

## Sample of Python script for adding device with the FMC REST API, using REST calls

The following script is an example of a Python script for adding a

```python
import json
import sys
import requests

server = "https://fmcrestapisandbox.cisco.com"

username = "admin"
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    username = sys.argv[1]
password = "sf"
if len(sys.argv) > 2:
    password = sys.argv[2]

r = None
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
api_auth_path = "/api/fmc_platform/v1/auth/generatetoken"
auth_url = server + api_auth_path
try:
    # 2 ways of making a REST call are provided:
    # One with "SSL verification turned off" and the other with "SSL verification turned on".
    # The one with "SSL verification turned off" is commented out. If you like to use that then
    # uncomment the line where verify=False and comment the line with =verify='/path/to/ssl_certificate'
    #
    # REST call with SSL verification turned off:
    r = requests.post(auth_url, headers=headers, auth=requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(username,password), verify=False)
    # REST call with SSL verification turned on: Download SSL certificates from your FMC first and provide its path for verification.
    # r = requests.post(auth_url, headers=headers, auth=requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(username,password), verify='/path/to/ssl_certificate')
    auth_headers = r.headers
    auth_token = auth_headers.get('X-auth-access-token', default=None)
    if auth_token == None:
        print("auth_token not found. Exiting...")

url = server + api_path
if (url[-1] == '/'):
    url = url[:-1]

# POST OPERATION
# When adapting this script to your own environment, update the following JSON parameters here:
# hostname, name, natID (if sensor behind the nat), registration key (created when device is configured).
# To obtain the access policy UUID number, perform a GET operation on the access policy.

try:

    status_code = r.status_code
    resp = r.text
    print("Status code is: "+str(status_code))
    if status_code == 201 or status_code == 202:
        print ("Post was successful...")
        json_resp = json.loads(resp)
        print(json.dumps(json_resp,sort_keys=True,indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))

finally:
    if r: r.close()
