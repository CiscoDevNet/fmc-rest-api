Adding device or sensor to FMC is a *two* step process:

1. Add FMC on the sensor or device.
2. Register the device or sensor to the FMC.

There are two ways to register a device:
* FMC UI
* FMC REST API

For both methods, registering a device requires one CLI step on the device itself for both methods. The next sections in this Learning Lab will describe the procedures.
