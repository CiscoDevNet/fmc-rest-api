# Firewall devices and sensors and the Firepower Management Center (FMC)

Learn how to add the FMC to firewall devices or sensors and register the device to the FMC, enabling the device or sensor to use the FMC.

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to learn how to:

1. Add FMC to a device or sensor.
2. Register a device to the FMC with the FMC UI.
3. Register a device to the FMC through the FMC REST API.

## Prerequisites
* A development environment with typical tools and applications, as well as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
* Basic understanding of REST principles. Complete the [REST API Fundamentals Learning Lab](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-beginner/rest-api-fundamentals/what-are-rest-apis/step/1)
* Basic understanding of FCM REST APIs and the FMC REST API Explorer. Complete [Exploring Firepower Management Center (FMC) REST APIs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/Firepower/firepower-restapi-101/step/1).

## How do we add sensors or devices (NGIPS, NGFW) to FMC?
Let's look at this simple network setup with FMC and two devices:

Adding device or sensor to FMC is a *two* step process:

1. Add FMC on the sensor or device.
2. Register the device or sensor to the FMC.

There are two ways to register a device:
* FMC UI
* FMC REST API

For both methods, registering a device requires one CLI step on the device itself for both methods. The next sections in this Learning Lab will describe the procedures.
