# FMC - REST - API - 103

## Lab objective

Learn how to add a firewall device/sensor to Firepower Management Center (FMC).


## Prerequisites
Basic understanding of firewalls, networks, REST principles.


## Learning objective
After completing this module you will have basic understanding of adding devices to FMC.


## How do we add sensors or devices (NGIPS, NGFW) to FMC?
Let's look at this simple network setup with FMC and two devices:

Adding device or sensor to FMC is a *two* step process:

1. Add FMC on the sensor or device.
2. Add device or sensor to the FMC.

There are two ways to add a device. One is through FMC UI, and the other is through REST API. But adding a device does require one CLI step on the device itself for both methods.

## Adding FMC on the device or sensor
  Connect to the CLI of the device that you want register with FMC. This device could be any FTD or Firepower physical or virtual appliances.

2. Log in (ssh) with the username admin or another username that has the CLI configuration (Administrator) access level.

3. At the prompt, register the device to a FMC using the configure manager add command.

  Note: A unique alphanumeric registration key is always required to register a device to an FMC. This is a simple key that you specify, and is not the same as a license key.

  The command has the following syntax:
```shell
  $configure manager add <hostname | IPv4_address | IPv6_address | DONTRESOLVE> reg_key <nat_id>
```
In the above syntax:
- `<hostname | IPv4_address | IPv6_address | DONTRESOLVE> ` specifies either the fully qualified host name or IP address of the FMC. If the FMC is not directly addressable, use DONTRESOLVE.
- `reg_key` is an unique alphanumeric registration key required to register a device to the FMC.
- `nat_id` is an optional alphanumeric string used during the registration process between the FMC and the device. It is required if the hostname is set to DONTRESOLVE.

  In most cases, you must provide the FMC's hostname or the IP address along with the registration key. Example:
```shell
  $configure manager add FMC_IP_Address my_reg_key
```
  However, if the device and the FMC are separated by a NAT device, enter a unique NAT ID along with the registration key, and specify DONTRESOLVE instead of the hostname. Example:
  ```shell
  $configure manager add DONTRESOLVE my_reg_key my_nat_id
  ```

  In the following example, there is no NAT boundary between the FMC and the managed device, and 123456 is used as a registration key.
```shell
  $configure manager add 192.0.2.2 123456Manager successfully configured.
```
## Adding a device through FMC UI
To register a device to an FMC you need to create an access policy. You can do this either through REST API or through FMC UI.

To create an access policy through FMC UI, choose Policies > Access Control > Access Control.

  1.	Go to device management page on the FMC UI.
  2.	An “Add Device” dialog box will pop up. Provide the hostname or the IP address of the device in “Host”. Also provide the registration key that you provided in sensor, and the access policy that you just created.   
  3.	If you provided a NAT ID, then expand the “Advanced” tab, and provide the NAT ID.

Note: Steps of adding FMC on device is same for both methods (UI or APIs) of adding device to the FMC.
