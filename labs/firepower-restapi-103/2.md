# Adding a device through FMC REST API

As mentioned previously under UI section, you have to add FMC to the device using command
line (CLI) on the device. Same steps of adding FMC to device apply for REST API device add to FMC as well.

Please watch this video on the device registration process [FMC device setup](https://youtu.be/7eTFSfL0EkU)  
#### Here is the sample python script for adding device through FMC using REST calls

```python
import json
import sys
import requests

server = "https://fmcrestapisandbox.cisco.com"

username = "admin"
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    username = sys.argv[1]
password = "sf"
if len(sys.argv) > 2:
    password = sys.argv[2]

r = None
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
api_auth_path = "/api/fmc_platform/v1/auth/generatetoken"
auth_url = server + api_auth_path
try:
    # 2 ways of making a REST call are provided:
    # One with "SSL verification turned off" and the other with "SSL verification turned on".
    # The one with "SSL verification turned off" is commented out. If you like to use that then
    # uncomment the line where verify=False and comment the line with =verify='/path/to/ssl_certificate'
    # REST call with SSL verification turned off:
    r = requests.post(auth_url, headers=headers, auth=requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(username,password), verify=False)
    # REST call with SSL verification turned on: Download SSL certificates from your FMC first and provide its path for verification.
    # r = requests.post(auth_url, headers=headers, auth=requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(username,password), verify='/path/to/ssl_certificate')
    auth_headers = r.headers
    auth_token = auth_headers.get('X-auth-access-token', default=None)
    if auth_token == None:
        print("auth_token not found. Exiting...")
        sys.exit()
except Exception as err:
    print ("Error in generating auth token --> "+str(err))
    sys.exit()

headers['X-auth-access-token']=auth_token

api_path = "/api/fmc_config/v1/domain/e276abec-e0f2-11e3-8169-6d9ed49b625f/devices/devicerecords"    # param
url = server + api_path
if (url[-1] == '/'):
    url = url[:-1]

# POST OPERATION
# What to change in this sample JSON data , hostname, name, natID (if sensor behind the nat) or use just the regkey (created when device is configured). Do a "get" on the accesspolicy to obtain id of accessPolicyUUID!

post_data = {
  "name": "xyz",
  "hostName": "abc.xyz",
  "natID": "cisco123",
  "regKey": "regkey",
  "type": "Device",
  "license_caps": [
    "BASE",
    "MALWARE",
    "URLFilter",
    "THREAT"
  ],
  "accessPolicy": {
    "id": "accessPolicyUUID",
    "type": "AccessPolicy"
  }
}
try:
    # REST call with SSL verification turned off:
    r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(post_data), headers=headers, verify=False)
    # REST call with SSL verification turned on:
    #r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(post_data), headers=headers, verify='/path/to/ssl_certificate')
    status_code = r.status_code
    resp = r.text
    print("Status code is: "+str(status_code))
    if status_code == 201 or status_code == 202:
        print ("Post was successful...")
        json_resp = json.loads(resp)
        print(json.dumps(json_resp,sort_keys=True,indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))
    else :
        r.raise_for_status()
        print ("Error occurred in POST --> "+resp)
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
    print ("Error in connection --> "+str(err))
finally:
    if r: r.close()
```
