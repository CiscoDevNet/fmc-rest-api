### Access Control Policy Default Action
In a simple access control policy, the default action specifies how target devices handle all traffic. In a more complex policy, the default action handles traffic that:
* is not trusted by Intelligent Application Bypass.
* is not blacklisted by Security Intelligence.
* is not blocked by SSL inspection (encrypted traffic only).
* matches none of the rules in the policy (except Monitor rules, which match and log—but do not handle
or inspect—traffic).

The access control policy default action can block or trust traffic without further inspection, or inspect traffic for intrusions and discovery data.

| Default Action                    | Effect on Traffic                                                      | Inspection Type and Policy                                                                                                     |
|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Access Control: Block All Traffic | block without further inspection                                       | none                                                                                                                           |
| Access Control: Trust All Traffic | trust (allow to its final destination none without further inspection) | none                                                                                                                           |
| Intrusion Prevention              | allow, as long as it is passed by the intrusion policy you specify     | intrusion, using the specified intrusion policy and associated variable set, and discovery, using the network discovery policy |
| Network Discovery Only            | allow                                                                  | discovery only, using the network discovery policy                                                                             |
| Inherit from base policy          | defined in base policy                                                 | defined in base policy                                                                                                         |

### Access control policy inheritance
Access control uses a hierarchical, policy-based implementation that complements multitenancy. Just as you create a domain hierarchy, you can create a corresponding hierarchy of access control policies. For a descendant, or child, access control policy inherits rules and settings from its direct parent, or base, policy. That base policy may have its own parent policy from which it inherits rules and settings, and so on.

An access control policy’s rules are nested between its parent policy’s Mandatory and Default rule sections. This implementation enforces Mandatory rules from ancestor policies, but allows the current policy to write rules that preempt Default rules from ancestor policies.

You can lock the following settings to enforce them in all descendant policies. Descendant policies can override unlocked settings.  
* `Security Intelligence` — blacklisting and whitelisting connections based on the latest IP address, URL, and domain name reputation intelligence.  
* `HTTP Response pages` — displaying a custom or system-provided response page when you block a user's website request.  
* `Advanced settings` — specifying associated subpolicies, network analysis settings, performance settings, and other general options.  

Although an access control policy can inherit its default action from an ancestor policy, you cannot enforce this inheritance.
