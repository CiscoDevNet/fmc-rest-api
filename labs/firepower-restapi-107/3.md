# Access control policy inheritance

Access control uses a hierarchical, policy-based implementation that complements multitenancy. You can create a hierarchy of access control policies that corresponds to a domain hierarchy.

Child access control policies inherit rules and settings from their direct parent, or base, policy. That base policy may have its own parent policy from which it inherits rules and settings, and so on.

An access control policy’s rules are nested between its parent policy’s Mandatory and Default rule sections. This implementation enforces Mandatory rules from ancestor policies, but allows the current policy to write rules that preempt Default rules from ancestor policies.

You can lock the following settings to enforce them in all descendant policies. Descendant policies can override unlocked settings if needed.

* `Security Intelligence` — blacklisting and whitelisting connections based on the latest IP address, URL, and domain name reputation intelligence.  
* `HTTP Response pages` — displaying a custom or system-provided response page when you block a user's website request.  
* `Advanced settings` — specifying associated subpolicies, network analysis settings, performance settings, and other general options.  

Although an access control policy can inherit its default action from an ancestor policy, you cannot enforce this inheritance.
