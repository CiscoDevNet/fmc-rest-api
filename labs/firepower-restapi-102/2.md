# Refreshing an authentication token for FMC rest API
Firepower Management Center REST API authentication tokens are valid for 30 minutes, and can be refreshed up to three times.

Obtain valid authentication and refresh tokens[explained on previous page] from the Firepower Management Center REST API. Ensure these tokens have been refreshed less than three times.

Step 1  	Open your POSTMAN REST API Client.
Step 2  	Set the client to make a POST command to the following URL: https://<management_center_IP_or_name>/api/fmc_platform/v1/auth/refreshtoken
          with the headers X-auth-access-token:<authentication token value> and X-auth-refresh-token:<refresh token value>.

Here is the video showing above steps:
