# Requesting a FMC REST API authentication token with Postman

Before you begin, ensure that REST API is enabled in your FMC. This procedure is documented in [Firepower Management Center (FMC) REST APIs](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/Firepower/firepower-restapi-101/).

1. Open your POSTMAN REST API Client.
2. Click **New**.
3. In the **Create New** menu, select **Request**.
4. In the **Save Request** dialog, give your request a name (such as "FMC Token") and create or select a collection or folder where the request will be saved.
5. At the top of the request tab, select **POST** from the drop-down menu and enter the following URL: `https://<management_center_IP_or_name>/api/fmc_platform/v1/auth/generatetoken`.
6. Select the **Authorization** tab, and choose **Basic Auth** from the **Type** menu.
7. Enter your username and password in the appropriate fields.
8. Click **Send**.

The response will appear under **Headers**. You will see that the response includes two tokens with values generated by the API:

* **X-auth-access-token**: Include in every request that you send to the FMC REST API.
* **X-auth-refresh-token**: Use in conjunction with the access token when you want to refresh the authentication token.

Be sure to copy and paste these tokens to save them for later use.

You can review a video that documents these steps [here](https://youtu.be/jjj6A-5747k). Note that there is no audio for this video.
