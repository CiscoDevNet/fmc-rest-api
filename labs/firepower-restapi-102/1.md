#  Overview of FMC REST token authentication

Token-based authentication enables you to access an HTTP or HTTPS service for a limited time period without the need to enter a username and password with every request. The username and password credentials are replaced by with a uniquely generated access token, which enables access to resources for up to 30 minutes, and which can be refreshed up to three times.

When you are generating authentication tokens, be sure to use different credentials for authenticating with the FMC API and the FMC UI. Credentials cannot be used for both interfaces simultaneously, and will be logged out without warning if used for both.

The following diagram illustrates the concept of token-based authentication:
