# FMC - REST - API - 102

## Lab Objective

Basic understanding of FMC REST API authentication and access.  

Completion time: 15 minutes

## Prerequisites
Basic understanding of REST principles
Basic understanding of HTTP authentication.

## Learning Objective
After completing this module you will have basic understanding of accessing FMC REST APIs using tokens.


## How does  FMC REST Token Authentication Works?
Cisco FMC recommends that you use different accounts for interfacing with the API and the Firepower User Interface. Credentials cannot be used for both interfaces simultaneously, and will be logged out without warning if used for both.

The first time you connect to the REST API you may receive an error that the connection is not secure due to an invalid certificate. Add an exception in your browser to use the certificate and accept the connection.

With Token Based Authentication you obtain a token by providing your username and password. You use this token to access an HTTP service for a limited time period without the need for the username and password with every request. In other words, to eliminate the need for authenticating with your username and password with each request, you replace user credentials with a uniquely generated access token, which you use for accessing resources for up to 30 minutes and can refresh up to three times.

The diagram below illustrates the concept of token-based authentication:

## Requesting FMC REST API Authentication Token Using POSTMAN(https://www.getpostman.com/)
To use REST API in FMC, make sure REST API is turned on in your FMC.
Step 1  	Open your POSTMAN REST API Client.
Step 2  	Set the client to make a POST command to the following URL: https://<management_center_IP_or_name>/api/fmc_platform/v1/auth/generatetoken.
Step 3  	Include the username and password as a basic authentication header. The POST body should be blank.

You need to add this token and header to every request to FMC REST API X-auth-access-token: and X-auth-refresh-token: you need these two headers for requests to refresh the token

Important headers to look for in the response:
1. X-auth-access-token:<authentication token value>  -- You need to add this token and header to every request to FMC REST API
2. X-auth-access-token:<authentication token value> and X-auth-refresh-token:<refresh token value> 

You need these two headers for requests to refresh the token
