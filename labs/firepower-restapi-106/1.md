# Firepower Management Center (FMC) objects

FMC uses **named objects**. A named object is a reusable configuration that associates a name with a value. When you want to use that value, use the named object instead. FMC provides many predefined objects that represent frequently used configurations. You can use objects in policies, rules, event searches, reports, and dashboards.

## Objects in context of FMC multitenancy

In a multi-domain Firepower deployment, you can create objects in the *Global* parent domain, and these objects will be inherited by child domains. The exception is *Security Group Tag (SGT)* objects, which you can create only in the *Global* domain.

The FMC UI displays objects created in the selected domain, which you can edit. It also displays objects created in parent domains, which you cannot edit, with the exception of security zones and interface groups.

**Note:** Because security zones and interface groups are linked to device interfaces, which you configure at the leaf level, administrators in child domains can view and edit zones and groups created in parent domains. Subdomain users can add and delete interfaces from parent zones and groups, but cannot delete or rename the zones/groups.

## Object names

Object names must be unique within the domain hierarchy. If there is an object with an identical name in an object's parent or child domain, FMC will generate an error.

## Object groups

An object group enables you to reference multiple objects with a single configuration. The FMC UI enables you to use objects and object groups interchangeably. For example, anywhere you would use a port object, you can also use a port object group.

Object groups have the following characteristics and restrictions:

* You can group objects in the current domain with objects inherited from parent domains.
* You can group network, port, VLAN tag, URL, and PKI objects.
* Network object groups can be nested. In other words, you can add a network object group to another network object group up to 10 levels.
* Objects and object groups of the same type cannot have the same name.
* In a multidomain deployment, the names of object groups must be unique within the domain hierarchy.

## Object overrides

Object overrides enable you to define device-specific or domain-specific values for certain types of object, including network, port, VLAN tag, and URL. In a multi-domain deployment, you can define a default value for an object in a parent domain, but allow administrators in child domains to add override values for that object. Object overrides enable you to create a smaller set of shared policies for use across devices while still allowing you to alter policies as needed for individual devices.

In a typical use case, you will create an object whose definition works for most devices, and then use overrides to specify modifications to the object for a few devices that need different definitions.

**Example:** You want to deny ICMP traffic to the different departments in your company, each of
which is connected to a different network. You can define an access control policy with a rule that includes a network object called **Departmental Network**. By allowing overrides for this object, you can then create overrides on any device that specifies the actual network where that device is connected.

## Supported object types

The following table lists the object types supported by FMC and indicates whether they can be placed in groups, if they permit overrides, and if they are supported with the FMC REST API.
