# The FMC network object

The **network object** is the most frequently used FMC object. A network object represents one or more IP addresses. You can use network objects and groups in various places in the systemâ€™s web interface, including but not limited to access control policies, network variables, intrusion rules, identity rules, network discovery rules, event searches, and reports.

When you configure an option that requires a network object, the list is automatically filtered to show only those objects that are valid for the option. For example, some options require host objects, while other options require subnets.

A network object can be one of the following types:

* **Host**
A single IP address.
`IPv4 example: 209.165.200.225`
`IPv6 example: 2001:DB8::0DB8:800:200C:417A or 2001:DB8:0:0:0DB8:800:200C:417A`

* **Network**
An address block, also known as a subnet.
`IPv4 example: 209.165.200.224/27`
`IPv6 example: 2001:DB8:0:CD30::/60`

* **Address Range**
A range of IP addresses.
`IPv4 example: 209.165.200.225-209.165.200.250`
`IPv6 example: 2001:db8:0:cd30::1-2001:db8:0:cd30::1000`

* **Group**
A group of network objects or other network object groups.
For example:
`209.165.200.225
209.165.201.1
209.165.202.129`

You can create nested groups by adding one network object group to another network object group. You can nest up to 10 levels of groups.
