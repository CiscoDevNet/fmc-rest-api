# FMC REST API 112

## Objectives

This lab teaches you the basic understanding of Firepower Management Center (FMC) REST based APIs CRUD operations.   

## Prerequisites
Basic understanding of REST principles and firewalls.


## Read operation GET
If you are using the [DevNet Sandbox](https://fmcrestapisandbox.cisco.com/api/api-explorer/), for this workshop session the username and password is provided to you. These credentials are only valid for this session.

If you are learning at home or in an office please follow instructions below:

**Note on obtaining username/password for FMC sandbox:**

The API Explorer URL is publically available. However, in order to login to the FMC, users must first be allocated credentials. This is done by reserving the lab for however long you require access, i.e. click the "RESERVE" button in the upper right of the Firepower Management Center sandbox page which can be accessed with this URL: https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/docs/index.gsp#security/overview

  Select Firepower Management Center from the above page.

  You will require cisco.com credentials to access the reservation page from the above URL.

  Once reserved, a username/password will be sent to you via email and also displayed in the output window on this page. These credentials are valid for the duration of your reservation. You will not be able to login to the API Explorer once the reservation has ended.

  If further access is required, just reserve the lab again and new credentials will be sent.

  As this is an always on lab and resources are shared, users are allocated read-only rights.


Click Objects. Then scroll and find Network object. Click GET.

Since this is a READ operation you can press *GET* on the *API CONSOLE* pane to get all of the network objects from FMC.

Alternatively, you can copy JSON from here.

*You need to modify name to avoid conflicts with other API users*

```JSON
{
  "name": "Clus-17",
  "value": "1.0.0.0/24",
  "overridable": false,
  "description": "Test REST API Object",
  "type": "Network"
}
```



Copy and paste the JSON in the API CONSOLE *Body* section, and click POST.
