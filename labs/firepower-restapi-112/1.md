This is done by reserving the lab for however long you require access i.e. hit the "RESERVE" button in the upper right of the Firepower Management Center sandbox page which can be access on this URL: https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/docs/index.gsp#security/overview

  Select Firepower Management Center from the above page.

  You will require cisco.com credentials to access the reservation page from the above URL

  Once reserved, a username/password will be sent to you via email and also displayed in the output window on this page. These credentials are valid for the duration of your reservation. You will not be able to login to the API Explorer once the reservation as ended.

  If further access is required, just reserve the lab again and new credentials will be sent out.

  As this is an always on lab and resources are shared, users are allocated read only rights.
