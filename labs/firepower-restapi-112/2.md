## Update operation PUT

PUT operation requires you to do GET operation first as you need to find the Network object you are interested in modifying

Do the GET as explained in the previous page, try to locate the network object you are interested in modifying in API CONSOLE.
Once you locate the object *copy* it's UUID and keep it for the PUT operation

Click on PUT

You will paste the object UUID in the API CONSOLE *Object ID* window

You have to provide following required field based on your GET operation above
1. *id* it the UUID you saved during your GET operation
2. *name* it can be same from your GET operation or you can modify it

```JSON
{
  "type": "Network",
  "value": "1.2.3.0/24",
  "overridable": false,
  "description": "Test Description",
  "id": "networkObjectUUID",         
  "name": "network_obj_name"
}
```
