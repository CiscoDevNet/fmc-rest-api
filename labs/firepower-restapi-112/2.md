## Update operation PUT

The PUT operation requires you to do a GET operation first, as you need to find the Network object you are interested in modifying.

Do the GET as explained in the previous page; locate the network object you are interested in modifying in the API CONSOLE. Once you locate the object, *copy* its UUID and keep it for the PUT operation.

Click on PUT.

You will paste the object UUID in the API CONSOLE *Object ID* window. You also need to copy and paste the JSON for the modified network object.

You have to provide the following required field based on your GET operation above:
1. *id* - it is the UUID you saved during your GET operation.
2. *name*  - it can be same from your GET operation, or you can modify it.

```JSON
{
  "type": "Network",
  "value": "1.2.3.0/24",
  "overridable": false,
  "description": "Test Description",
  "id": "networkObjectUUID",         
  "name": "network_obj_name"
}
```

Once you have the JSON modified and pasted in the API CONSOLE window, press PUT.
