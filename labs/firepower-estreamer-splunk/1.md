## Learning Objective

After Completing this module, you will be able to:

-   Stream events from a FMC to a Splunk instance using eStreamer

-   Create Splunk apps that can visualize the data provided by the FMC

## eStreamer API

The Firepower Management Center’s (FMC) eStreamer API streams Firepower events to remote clients. Users can choose which event types they wish to stream and can stream events to multiple remote clients.

## Configuring eStreamer:

1.  Navigate to the FMC UI

    1.  For the DEVNET live sandbox VPN into the Sandbox and navigate to: https://10.10.20.40

2.  **Log in** with your username and password

3.  Navigate via the menu to: **System \> Integration \> eStreamer**

4.  In the left-hand panel select that event types shown in the screenshot below and click **‘Save’**
