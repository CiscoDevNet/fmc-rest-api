## eNcore eStreamer Client

eNcore is a new all-purpose client which requests all possible events from eStreamer, parses the binary content and outputs events in various formats to support SIEMs. eNcore supports Common Information Model (CIM) for broad support with Splunk.

## Setting up eNcore

The eNcore client will need the client certificate obtained above to connect to the FMC. For in-depth instructions for installing eNcore refer to the eStreamer eNcore Operations Guide.

1.  SCP the client certificate to the Splunk server

    a.  For DEVNET live sandbox run the following command:
    ```
    scp ~/Downloads/10.10.20.25_13.pkcs12 <your username>@fmcsplunk.cisco.com:~/encore/client.pksc12
    ```
2.  SSH into the Splunk server.

    a.  For the DEVNET live sandbox SSH into fmcsplunk.cisco.com using your username and password.
    ```
    ssh <your username>@fmcsplunk.cisco.com
    ``` 
3.  The sandbox will have the eNcore client already available to you in your home directory: `~/encore`

4.  Once you have SSH’ed into the server change directories into the \~/encore directory and then run a setup the client and test to ensure the client can connect.
    ```
    cd ~/encore/
    ./encore.sh test
    ```
5.  This will begin a wizard to configure your eNcore client to connect to the FMC.

6.  The wizard will ask you, “Would you like to configure it now? (y/n) [y]”

    a.  Type in **‘y’** and hit **enter**

7.  The wizard will then ask you to, “Enter the IP or FQDN of the FMC host:

    a.  Enter in the IP or FQDN of the FMC and hit enter.

    b.  For DEVNET live sandbox users type **‘10.10.20.161’**

8.  The wizard will ask for confirmation of the IP.

    a.  Type in **‘y’** and hit **enter**

9.  Lastly, the wizard will ask you to enter in the password. If the password was not configured for the certificate, hit enter.

10. You should then see test output with the last line stating **‘Connection successful’**

## Using eNcore

eNcore now needs to start running on your system to being streaming event from the FMC and outputting the events in a Splunk compliant CIM format. By default, the data files will be located in the encore/data/splunk directory.

1.  Start encore by running the following command:
    ```
    ./encore.sh start
    ```
2.  Validate that encore has begun streaming events to the server by running the following command
    ```
    tail data/splunk/encore.log*
    ```
3.  If events are shown, then eNcore has been configured successfully

4.  If you get an error stating, “No such file or directory,” then something went wrong with the encore configuration and run ./encore.sh test once again.

5.  If no events are shown then the FMC might not have any events to send at this time. Check the FMC configuration and ensure events are being populate on the FMC via checking the Dashboard.
